# Arcade Archive
Arcade Archive is a full-stack web application designed to help users manage their personal game collection. Built with Java and PostgreSQL on the backend and React and JavaScript on the frontend, it offers a seamless and interactive user experience.

Everything you need to explore or build the project can be found in the individual directories:

 • java/ – Contains the backend source code, database setup, and project configuration.

 • react/ – Contains the frontend source code built with React.

Each directory includes its own README and setup instructions to help you get started. This project was developed as the final capstone for my 14-week full-stack development bootcamp at Tech Elevator.

Below are a few screenshots showcasing the final user interface of the completed project. Thank you for viewing!
