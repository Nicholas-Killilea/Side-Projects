# Arcade Archive
Welcome to Arcade Archive! This project was completed during my time at Tech Elevator as my final capstone project. This full-stack application was built using Java and PostgreSQL on the backend, and React and JavaScript on the frontend.

Everything you need to explore or build the project can be found in the individual directories:

 • java/ – Contains the backend source code, database setup, and project configuration.

 • react/ – Contains the frontend source code built with React.

Each directory includes its own README and setup instructions to help you get started.

Below are a few screenshots showcasing the final user interface of the completed project.
